Problem Statement: To have maximum yield, there is a need for optimum irrigation. 
The need for water depends on various parameters like soil moisture, water level, 
weather condition etc. Currently, irrigation happens based on human inspection and 
does not take into account various parameters which make it optimal. 

The aforementioned parameters can be measured and well used in optimizing water delivery 
as well as biological macro-nutrients in some form. Using historical/agricultural data 
helps further in providing real-time irrigation requirement by ensuring optimal 
usage of water to get the improved yield.

Objectives:
--> To improve the yield by optimizing the usage of water in the fields 
--> To recommend the macro-nutrients requirement to the farmer by real-time monitoring 
of soil parameters

Introduction:

Sensor Data Collection: Sensor Module will sense soil moisture, Macro nutrients(NPK) 
at regular  intervals.

Communication: The data collected by sensor module will be transmitted wirelessly to micro-
controller(Raspberry Pi) through ESP8266 Wi-fi module.

Data Analytics :Analysis will be done on the collected data from the senor module and
weather data.

Action : Farmer will be notified and the system will control water delivery automatically.
Optical sensors is used to measure the macro -nutrients (N,P,K values).

*Microprocessor (raspberry pi) processes the collected data from the sensor module.

*Machine learning model will be used to analyze the data from the sensor module and Neural Network
is applied to generate recommendations for the optimized yield

*Internet connectivity will be used for communication with the cloud server.
